# Week 1 - Lecture Notes
## Working example: pendulum lab experiment

- Objective: to investigate the relationship between the length of a pendulum and its time period T, or the time taken for one oscillation.
- Data collected: the time taken for 10 oscillations (independent variable) and the string length (dependent variable). This is repeated 10 times. 
- Equation: $$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
- Graph: A straight line graph of $T^2$ vs $L$, where the gradient is equal to: $$\frac{4\pi^2}{g}$$
