"""
A 'special number' is one that is:
    - even
    - divisible by 3 
    - greater than 10

In your program, write a program that inputs a number 'n' and then prints out whether
n is a special number or not. The output format should be:
    (if it's a special number)
    Yes, n is a special number
    (or if it isn't)
    No, n is not a special number
